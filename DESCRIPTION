Description: The development of long-read sequencing technologies has 
    introduced a powerful new tool to the field of epigenetics by enabling
     the direct detection of DNA modifications, such as DNA methylation, at 
     single-base resolution. This produces novel opportunities for studying
    the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation, imprinting, and disease.
    Analysis of the data produced by long-read sequencing technologies requires
    the development of new software tools to handle the unique characteristics
    of the data, such as the modBAM format in which the data is output, and the
    length of the sequenced reads. The `NanoMethViz` package provides a suite
    of tools for loading in this methylation data, visualising regional and
    genome-wide methylation patterns, and exporting data for identifying
    differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using other Bioconductor software
    such as `bsseq`, `DSS`, `dmrseq` and `edgeR`. In this workflow article, we
    demonstrate how to use the `NanoMethViz` package and other Bioconductor
    software to perform a complete analysis of long-read 5mC DNA methylation
    data starting from the raw data, to exploratory analysis, DMR
    identification, and visualisation of the results.
