Description: In this workflow, we will demonstrate how to use the `NanoMethViz` 
    package to analyze methylation data generated by ONT long-read sequencing. 
    The `NanoMethViz` package provides a suite of tools for analyzing and
    visualizing methylation data generated by ONT sequencing, including functions
    for loading in methylation data, visualizing methylation patterns, and exporting
    data for identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using other 
    Bioconductor software such as bsseq, DSS, dmrseq and edgeR.
