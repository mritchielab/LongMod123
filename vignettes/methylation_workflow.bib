With its ability to simultaneously call sequence variation and DNA modifications including 5-methylcytosine, nanopore is a promising technology to improve diagnostics of imprinting disorders.

Here we present NanoImprint, which generates an easily interpretable report, based on long-read nanopore sequencing, to use for identifying clinical relevant abnormalities in methylation levels at 14 imprinted regions and diagnosis of common imprinting disorders. Results and conclusion NanoImprint outputs a summarizing table and visualization plots displays methylation frequency (\%) and chromosomal positions for all regions, with phased data color-coded for the two alleles. We demonstrate the utility of NanoImprint using three imprinting disorder samples from patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).

  abstract = {DNA methylation is essential for mammalian development and has notable roles in gene silencing, protection against spurious repetitive element activity, genomic stability during mitosis and parent-of-origin imprinting.DNA methylation functions to coordinately silence some promoter and enhancer classes that are typified by low overall CpG density. By contrast, many CpG islands, particularly those at promoters, remain generally and constitutively protected from DNA methylation through numerous opposing cis- and trans-based mechanisms.Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remain one of the most highly studied in vitro models for dissecting epigenetic mechanisms during cellular differentiation. They are unique in their ability to retain the molecular characteristics of their cellular state in the absence of DNA methylation but cannot differentiate into embryonic lineages while simultaneously gaining extra-embryonic potential.ESCs are also unique in their heterogeneous ability to maintain repetitive element silencing through DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) maintenance activity alone and rely on the DNMT3 enzymes to re-silence these elements continuously de novo. The pre-implantation stage of development is one of the few stages at which endogeneous transposable elements are actively regulated.Promoters of germline-specific genes are coordinately repressed by DNMT3B in embryonic lineages and are reactivated during the global demethylation that accompanies primordial germ cell (PGC) specification.Haematopoiesis has served as a benchmark model for the function of DNA methylation in adult stem cells and in later lineage specification. Several notable regulatory principles for DNA methylation were originally or comprehensively described in this system, including the gating of lymphoid versus myeloid fates, the dynamics of intragenic CpG island methylation in transcript selection and demethylation as a lineage stabilizer by providing a mitotically heritable memory of transcription factor binding.DNA methylation is globally erased during specification of the germ line and during fertilization, at which point the paternal genome is specifically demethylated. These two key events have numerous related cascades of chromatin re-organization that suggest similar epigenetic mechanisms for erasure and re-establishment of global nuclear organization, although the relationship between these events remains incompletely defined.Although they have remained mysterious for more than 2 decades, the targets and mechanisms for DNA methylation erasure in the paternal genome as well as for protection of the maternal genome during fertilization are becoming clearer. For example, there are distinct temporal windows for global hydroxymethylation followed by erasure to unmodified cytosines occurring later in zygotic progression. The epigenetic determinants that retain silencing at repetitive element classes and imprints are less clear, but they are likely to be discovered as the dynamics and relationships of other epigenetic regulators are refined.},

  abstract = {In the mammalian genome, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism involving the transfer of a methyl group onto the C5 position of the cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine. DNA methylation regulates gene expression by recruiting proteins involved in gene repression or by inhibiting the binding of transcription factor(s) to DNA. During development, the pattern of DNA methylation in the genome changes as a result of a dynamic process involving both de novo DNA methylation and demethylation. As a consequence, differentiated cells develop a stable and unique DNA methylation pattern that regulates tissue-specific gene transcription. In this chapter, we will review the process of DNA methylation and demethylation in the nervous system. We will describe the DNA (de)methylation machinery and its association with other epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications and noncoding RNAs. Intriguingly, postmitotic neurons still express DNA methyltransferases and components involved in DNA demethylation. Moreover, neuronal activity can modulate their pattern of DNA methylation in response to physiological and environmental stimuli. The precise regulation of DNA methylation is essential for normal cognitive function. Indeed, when DNA methylation is altered as a result of developmental mutations or environmental risk factors, such as drug exposure and neural injury, mental impairment is a common side effect. The investigation into DNA methylation continues to show a rich and complex picture about epigenetic gene regulation in the central nervous system and provides possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

Our software can handle methylation output generated from a range of different methylation callers and manages large datasets using a compressed data format. To fully explore the methylation patterns in a dataset, NanoMethViz allows plotting of data at various resolutions. At the sample-level, we use dimensionality reduction to look at the relationships between methylation profiles in an unsupervised way. We visualize methylation profiles of classes of features such as genes or CpG islands by scaling them to relative positions and aggregating their profiles. At the finest resolution, we visualize methylation patterns across individual reads along the genome using the spaghetti plot and heatmaps, allowing users to explore particular genes or genomic regions of interest. In summary, our software makes the handling of methylation signal more convenient, expands upon the visualization options for nanopore data and works seamlessly with existing methylation analysis tools available in the Bioconductor project.

In the past decade, great strides have been made in characterizing epigenetic changes during normal development and in disease states like cancer. However, the epigenetic landscape has grown increasingly complicated, encompassing DNA methylation, the histone code, noncoding RNA, and nucleosome positioning, along with DNA sequence. As a stable repressive mark, DNA methylation, catalyzed by the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), is regarded as a key player in epigenetic silencing of transcription. DNA methylation may coordinately regulate the chromatin status via the interaction of DNMTs with other modifications and with components of the machinery mediating those marks. In this review, we will comprehensively examine the current understanding of the connections between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks and discuss molecular mechanisms of transcriptional repression in development and in carcinogenesis.},

Meanwhile, research on other base modifications, including 6-methyladenine and 4-methylcytosine that are frequent in prokaryotes, has been impeded by the lack of a comparable technique. Bisulfite sequencing also suffers from a number of drawbacks that are difficult to surmount, among which DNA degradation, lack of specificity, or short reads with low sequence diversity. In this review, we explore the recent refinements to bisulfite sequencing protocols that enable targeting genomic regions of interest, detecting derivatives of 5-methylcytosine, and mapping single-cell methylomes. We then present the unique advantage of long-read sequencing in detecting base modifications in native DNA and highlight the respective strengths and weaknesses of PacBio and Nanopore sequencing for this application. Although analysing epigenetic data from long-read platforms remains challenging, the ability to detect various modified bases from a universal sample preparation, in addition to the mapping and phasing advantages of the longer read lengths, provide long-read sequencing with a decisive edge over short-read bisulfite sequencing for an expanding number of applications across kingdoms.},

Here we carry out a comprehensive assessment of the epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing1,2 to profile 103,982 nuclei (including 95,815 neurons and 8,167 non-neuronal cells) from 45 regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum and olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotated with signature genes, regulatory elements and transcription factors. These features indicate the potential regulatory landscape supporting the assignment of putative cell types and reveal repetitive usage of regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining subtypes. The DNA methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus varied continuously along spatial gradients. Using this deep dataset, we constructed an artificial neural network model that precisely predicts single neuron cell-type identity and brain area spatial location. Integration of high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data3 enabled prediction of high-confidence enhancer-gene interactions for all identified cell types, which were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin conformation capture experiments4. By combining multi-omic datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum.},

In most applications, biologists are interested in detecting differentially methylated regions, composed of multiple sites with differing methylation levels among populations. However, current computational approaches for detecting such regions do not provide accurate statistical inference. A major challenge in reporting uncertainty is that a genome-wide scan is involved in detecting these regions, which needs to be accounted for. A further challenge is that sample sizes are limited due to the costs associated with the technology. We have developed a new approach that overcomes these challenges and assesses uncertainty for differentially methylated regions in a rigorous manner. Region-level statistics are obtained by fitting a generalized least squares regression model with a nested autoregressive correlated error structure for the effect of interest on transformed methylation proportions. We develop an inferential approach, based on a pooled null distribution, that can be implemented even when as few as two samples per population are available. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of our method using both experimental data and Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the new method improves the specificity and sensitivity of lists of regions and accurately controls the false discovery rate.},

  abstract = {Cytosine methylation is an important DNA epigenetic modification. In vertebrates, methylation occurs at CpG sites, which are dinucleotides where a cytosine is immediately followed by a guanine in the DNA sequence from 5' to 3'. When located in the promoter region of a gene, DNA methylation is often associated with transcriptional silencing of the gene. Aberrant DNA methylation is associated with the development of various diseases such as cancer. Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) is the current "gold-standard" technology for high-resolution profiling of DNA methylation. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is an efficient form of BS-seq that targets CpG-rich DNA regions in order to save sequencing costs. A typical bioinformatics aim is to identify CpGs that are differentially methylated (DM) between experimental conditions. This workflow demonstrates that differential methylation analysis of RRBS data can be conducted using software and methodology originally developed for RNA-seq data. The RNA-seq pipeline is adapted to methylation by adding extra columns to the design matrix to account for read coverage at each CpG, after which the RRBS and RNA-seq pipelines are almost identical. This approach is statistically natural and gives analysts access to a rich collection of analysis tools including generalized linear models, gene set testing and pathway analysis. The article presents a complete start to finish case study analysis of RRBS profiles of different cell populations from the mouse mammary gland using the Bioconductor package edgeR. We show that lineage-committed cells are typically hyper-methylated compared to progenitor cells and this is true on all the autosomes but not the sex chromosomes. We demonstrate a strong negative correlation between methylation of promoter regions and gene expression as measured by RNA-seq for the same cell types, showing that methylation is a regulatory mechanism involved in epithelial linear commitment.},

  abstract = {Motivation: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification with important roles in many biological processes and diseases. Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) has emerged recently as the technology of choice to profile DNA methylation because of its accuracy, genome coverage and higher resolution. Current statistical methods to identify differential methylation mainly focus on comparing two treatment groups. With an increasing number of experiments performed under a general and multiple-factor design, particularly in reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, there is a need to develop more flexible, powerful and computationally efficient methods.Results: We present a novel statistical model to detect differentially methylated loci from BS-seq data under general experimental design, based on a beta-binomial regression model with `arcsine' link function. Parameter estimation is based on transformed data with generalized least square approach without relying on iterative algorithm. Simulation and real data analyses demonstrate that our method is accurate, powerful, robust and computationally efficient.Availability and implementation: It is available as Bioconductor package DSS.Contact: ~yongpark@pitt.edu or hao.wu@emory.eduSupplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {The human genome is diploid, which requires assigning heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the two copies of the genome. The resulting haplotypes, lists of SNPs belonging to each copy, are crucial for downstream analyses in population genetics. Currently, statistical approaches, which are oblivious to direct read information, constitute the state-of-the-art. Haplotype assembly, which addresses phasing directly from sequencing reads, suffers from the fact that sequencing reads of the current generation are too short to serve the purposes of genome-wide phasing. While future-technology sequencing reads will contain sufficient amounts of SNPs per read for phasing, they are also likely to suffer from higher sequencing error rates. Currently, no haplotype assembly approaches exist that allow for taking both increasing read length and sequencing error information into account. Here, we suggest WhatsHap, the first approach that yields provably optimal solutions to the weighted minimum error correction problem in runtime linear in the number of SNPs. WhatsHap is a fixed parameter tractable (FPT) approach with coverage as the parameter. We demonstrate that WhatsHap can handle datasets of coverage up to 20{\texttimes}, and that 15{\texttimes} are generally enough for reliably phasing long reads, even at significantly elevated sequencing error rates. We also find that the switch and flip error rates of the haplotypes we output are favorable when comparing them with state-of-the-art statistical phasers.},

  abstract = {X-linked genetic disorders typically affect females less severely than males due to the presence of a second X chromosome not carrying the deleterious variant. However, the phenotypic expression in females is highly variable, which may be explained by an allelic skew in X chromosome inactivation. Accurate measurement of X inactivation skew is crucial to understand and predict disease phenotype in carrier females, with prediction especially relevant for degenerative conditions. We propose a novel approach using nanopore sequencing to quantify skewed X inactivation accurately. By phasing sequence variants and methylation patterns, this single assay reveals the disease variant, X inactivation skew, its directionality, and is applicable to all patients and X-linked variants. Enrichment of X-chromosome reads through adaptive sampling enhances cost-efficiency. Our study includes a cohort of 16 X-linked variant carrier females affected by two X-linked inherited retinal diseases: choroideremia and RPGR-associated retinitis pigmen-tosa. As retinal DNA cannot be readily obtained, we instead determine the skew from peripheral samples (blood, saliva and buccal mucosa), and correlate it to phenotypic outcomes. This revealed a strong correlation between X inactivation skew and disease presentation, confirming the value in performing this assay and its potential as a way to prioritise patients for early intervention, such as gene therapy currently in clinical trials for these conditions. Our method of assessing skewed X inactivation is applicable to all long-read genomic datasets, providing insights into disease risk and severity and aiding in the development of individualised strategies for X-linked variant carrier females.},

While phasing is an important step for answering questions about population genetics, compound heterozygosity, and to aid in clinical decision making, there has been a lack of accurate, usable and standards-based software. WhatsHap is a production-ready tool for highly accurate read-based phasing. It was designed from the beginning to leverage third-generation sequencing technologies, whose long reads can span many variants and are therefore ideal for phasing. WhatsHap works also well with second-generation data, is easy to use and will phase not only SNVs, but also indels and other variants. It is unique in its ability to combine read-based with pedigree-based phasing, allowing to further improve accuracy if multiple related samples are provided.},

  abstract = {The modulation of DNA-protein interactions by methylation of protein-binding sites in DNA and the occurrence in genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and fragile X syndrome of different methylation patterns in DNA of different chromosomal origin have underlined the need to establish methylation patterns in individual strands of particular genomic sequences. We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic DNA. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of genomic DNA, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. The sequence under investigation is then amplified by PCR with two sets of strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have been amplified as thymine and only 5-methylcytosine residues have been amplified as cytosine. The PCR products can be sequenced directly to provide a strand-specific average sequence for the population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to provide methylation maps of single DNA molecules. We tested the method by defining the methylation status within single DNA strands of two closely spaced CpG dinucleotides in the promoter of the human kininogen gene. During the analysis, we encountered in sperm DNA an unusual methylation pattern, which suggests that the high methylation level of single-copy sequences in sperm may be locally modulated by binding of protein factors in germ-line cells.},

Shared DNA sequence features adapt CGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state.

CGIs are therefore generically equipped to influence local chromatin structure and simplify regulation of gene activity.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},
